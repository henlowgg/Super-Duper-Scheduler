# My Portfolio
## Description
- The goal of this project was to develop a working day planner/scheduler to make tracking daily tasks more streamlined.
- Utilizing a well made scheduler can help anyone stay on top of their daily tasks and ensure proper usage of their time.
- Creating this scheduler has increased my working knowledge and utilization of bootstrap, jQuery, and javascript even more.

## Usage
- When enterering the application, simply click in the text box and input any information you need to properly schedule the day out.
- Time's are all color coordinated to make it so that you know right off the bat if the task is in the past, present or the future and will be colored as grey, green, and red respectively.
